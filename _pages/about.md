I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Université Paul Sabatier-Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse under the supervision of François Malgouyres and Sébastien Gerchinovitz. Prior to this, I graduated from École polytechnique and ENS Paris-Saclay. My research interests are the mathematical aspects of deep learning, be it optimization, approximation or generalization.
